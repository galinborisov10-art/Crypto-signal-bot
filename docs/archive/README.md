# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation from previous implementation phases.

## Purpose

These documents are kept for reference but may contain outdated information. They represent previous states of the system during development.

## Active Documentation Location

For current, up-to-date documentation:
- See `/docs/` for current system documentation
- See `AUDIT_REPORT.md` (PR #54) for latest data flow analysis
- See `README.md` for project overview

## Archive Contents

This directory will contain:
- Old IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md files from previous PRs
- Superseded documentation from earlier development phases
- Historical design documents no longer reflecting current architecture

## Guidelines

### When to Archive
- Documentation has been replaced by newer, more accurate version
- Feature or implementation approach has changed significantly
- Document describes temporary/experimental features that were removed

### When NOT to Archive
- Still-relevant historical context
- Design decisions that inform current architecture
- Migration guides still needed for understanding system evolution
